Basic Node js Express starter code.

Code creates an object from Class config and then uses a method to populate the instantiated object with config data from a json file in the db directory.

Next an Express endpoint is established using the port number pulled from the db json file.

Finally a simple method GET route is set up for /info to disply the combined object as a json structure.

To build\run\\test the app run ./build.bash
